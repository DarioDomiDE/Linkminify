# Linkminify - Specification

Task was creating an API which is able to transform any http link into a minimized and trackable link. 
The service should be able to track a click on such a generated link and also redirect the user to the initial URL.

Example: https://www.domain.com/some/very/long/path will become https://link.domain.com/abc123

The focus of the task is not speed but quality of code and architecture.
