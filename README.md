# Linkminify / Link Shortener

This Service is able to transform any http link into a minimized and trackable link, will track a click on such a generated link and also redirect the user to the initial URL. Example: https://doma.in/long/path will become https://link.doma.in/abc123. It provices an RESTful API and was build powered by NodeJS with ES6.
